MEETUP: Tech Interview Whiteboard Session
    2016/09/26:
        1. Longest Palindrome in a String
        2. Number of nodes in a complete BST

    2016/09/04:
        1) Implement BigInt class
        2) Copy a linked list with random pointers
        3) Print Vertical Sum of a tree

    2016/08/28:
        1)
        Activity Selection Problem / Find all NON overlapping intervals
           {{10,20}, {15,18}, {15,25}, {20,40}, {25, 30}}
           ANS: {{10, 20}, {20, 40}},
                {{10, 20}, {25, 30}},
                {{15, 18}, {20, 40}},
                {{15, 18}, {25, 30}},
                {{15, 25}, {25, 30}}

            HINT: Sort by end time

        2) 
        Add two numbers represented as a linked list
            a) Without using Additional Memory
            b) Using Recursion

        3)
        Non blocking Linked List

        4)
        Multi-threading problem
            Thread 1:   COST, GOOG, NTAP, FB
            Thread 2:   140,  750,  33,   160

            T1 should print SYMBOL and give control to T2
            T2 should print VALUE and give constrol to T1

            HINTS: If you consider with Callback, how will you break the cycle
                   wait(), notify(), notifyAll()
                   FIND WHAT IS TRAMPOLINE

            This can be real time and streaming. As you get each SYMBOL / VALUE print it and give control to the other thread

        5)
        Matix of 1s and 0s. Find area of the largest square matrix with all 1's
            a) How to do using multi-threading

    2016/08/14:
        1) Linked List Front Back Split
           I/p: 1->2->3->4->5
           O/p: 1->5->2->4->3

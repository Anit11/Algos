comments:   I got to the solution very quickly and hence thought the interview is over so i was disappointed . But like a real interviewer made me right a recursive solution. In that too patiently checked everything ,told where i can improve. or where i could possibly go wrong, helped me improve and write a bugless code. (y)

• Things you did well:

* Communicated well * Ran through an example before coding * Verified code afterward * Covered edge cases * Followed hints well

• Things you should work on:

* Initial example used was a special case (special cases don't make for good examples) * Had a bug in second example which complicated things for him (good idea to verify the example is bug free) * Took some convincing to use the language he's proficient in (unless mandated by the interview, it's _always_ a good idea to use a language one is proficient in)

• Things you did well:

Was able to solve the problem and come up with some elegant code designs and watch out for corner cases etc.

• Things you should work on:

A certain level of naivete was evident (am talking about spelling out the space complexity of a recursive program cannot be constant). I guess that is understandable from a fresher.

comments:   I think the peer pointed out a corner case that I missed a bit early. I woulve liked for them to wait and see if I had found it myself before pointing it out.

Used many approaches

• Things you did well:

starting to solve the problem on an example, various approaches to problem, thinking aloud

• Things you should work on:

it's better not to go into deep details while discussing your solution. that will save time for coding. watch out how you initialize your data stuctures. try to avoid nested if/for/while statements when it is possible, this will increase readability of your code.

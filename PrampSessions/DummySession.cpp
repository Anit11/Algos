Q1.
Given a binary search tree, produce an in-order list of all keys in the tree without using recursion.
Explain and code an efficient solution. Analyze the time and space complexities.

Follow Up Problem:
Same problem as above but this time you also can't use a stack or any additional memory besides the tree.

Q2:
Given a string L representing the letter and a string N representing the newspaper, return true if the L can be written entirely from N and false otherwise.
The letter includes only ascii characters.
